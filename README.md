# Deployment
As stated at the top of the README there is no live online deployment, however I have added a .ps1 that when run on the downloaded version of this project will start both the backend and frontend, with reporting in the console. 

The project is started by typing ".\start-project.ps1" into the console in the root
You can press CTRL + C to terminate the logs, however the servers will remain on
The project is terminated by typing Stop-Job * in that same terminal
